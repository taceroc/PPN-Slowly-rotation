# PPN-Slowly-rotation
Thesis project, named "Determination of the Orbital Elements for One Body under Parametrized Post Newtonian Metric", submitted for the degree of Bachelor of Physics at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.


Although the title of this work is very general; the principal objective of this project is to determine the orbit followed by a particle around a slowly rotating weak gravitational source. By being specific, with "weak gravitational source" we mean that the central body generates a weak gravitational field, therefore is not necessary to work with the general Einstein equations and the Post-Newtonian (PN) approximation is enough to determine the motion of the particle. We work up to the 1PN order.

In this repository is upload, in the Code folder, the Mathematica Notebook used to develop some of the algebraic steps that lead to the final results, as well as the Jupyter Notebook created to plot the results. In the Tesis folder is located the latex files of the final document.
